# The Hybrid Intelligence Competition (HI Comp)

Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is an emerging system design paradigm in which artificial intelligence (AI) augments, as opposed to replacing, human intelligence. Although there is an increasing emphasis on the idea of HI in the AI literature, there is a lack of systematic methods and metrics for developing HI systems.

The Hybrid Intelligence Competition (HI Comp), organized by the [Hybrid Intelligence Center](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/) in The Netherlands, aims to support the development of high-quality HI (Human-AI) teams, by exploring the possible benefits, risks, and consequences of collaboration between humans and AI systems.

HI Comp aims at pushing the state-of-the-art in Hybrid Intelligence design, and at generating a first repository of scenarios for researchers and practitioners to guide the development and evaluation of HI teams.

The first iteration of HI Comp had as a theme "fundamental qualities of HI teams". The participants of the competition is to formulate HI scenarios that yield best and worst quality HI teams.

The first iteration of HI Comp was run in three rounds, and led to 48 different HI scenarios (24 best and 24 worst case scenarios).
