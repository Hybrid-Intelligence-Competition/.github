# The Hybrid Intelligence Competition (HI Comp)

## Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is an emerging system design paradigm in which artificial intelligence (AI) augments, as opposed to replacing, human intelligence. Although there is an increasing emphasis on the idea of HI in the AI literature, there is a lack of systematic methods and metrics for developing HI systems.

## The Hybrid Intelligence Competition (HI Comp) aims to support the development of high-quality HI (Human-AI) teams, by exploring the possible benefits, risks, and consequences of collaboration between humans and AI systems.

## HI Comp aims at pushing the state-of-the-art in Hybrid Intelligence design, and at generating a first repository of scenarios for researchers and practitioners to guide the development and evaluation of HI teams.
